# Sardines
Our Senior Capstone project: A website that allows nurses and patients to get in contact with one another.

To host this site on your own server:
* Use phpMyAdmin or equivalent to import the comments and user SQL files.
* Alter the line in server.php in order to connect that file to your SQL database.
* Host files.
You're done!
